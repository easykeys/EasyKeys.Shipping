## How Stamps.com Address Validation Works

CleanseAddress as the name suggests provides address verification functionality.  

## Domestic Address Validation

SWS/IM requires you to verify the address for all domestic shipments. 
Once you have the destination address call CleanseAddress, this will verify the address is valid and also make formatting changes to
meet USPS addressing standard.  
When the response is received from the request the AddressMatch and `CityStateZipOk` fields are checked.

__AddressMatch__ : This is a Boolean value that is True if an exact match was found.

__CityStateZipOk__ : If this is true that means the street address provided
could not be verified but the city, state and the zip match each other. In this case, you can continue to
print postage for this address but it is probably worth informing the user that the street address could
not be verified.

Both fields are recorded in the ValidationBag of the ValidateAddress object.
  
## International Address Validation

Addresses cannot be verified for international shipments but we do verify the destination country. Please ensure
that you use a country name from the accepted list published here ‚Äê http://pe.usps.com/text/imm/immctry.htm.
